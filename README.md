<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

CheaterWatch is a web app developed to help to keep cheaters in videogames at bay. By publically displaying suspected cheater profiles along with evidence and a grading system for how intense their cheating is, CheaterWatch raises awareness of serial cheaters with the aim of getting more reports submitted about them and therefore a higher chance of them getting banned. We know that fighting cheaters is a losing battle (for now...) but we're doing our part to help.
